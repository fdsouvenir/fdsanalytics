## Deployment Process

### Initial Setup (One-time)

```bash
# 1. Setup infrastructure
./scripts/setup/create-service-accounts.sh
./scripts/setup/grant-iam-permissions.sh
./scripts/setup/create-bigquery-datasets.sh
./scripts/setup/create-secrets.sh
./scripts/setup/setup-cloud-scheduler.sh

# 2. Deploy all services
./scripts/deploy/deploy-all.sh

# 3. Verify health
./scripts/utilities/health-check-all.sh
```

### Continuous Deployment

```bash
# Push to main branch
git add .
git commit -m "Update service"
git push origin main

# GitHub Actions automatically:
# 1. Runs tests
# 2. Builds Docker images
# 3. Deploys to GCP
# 4. Runs smoke tests
```

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Deploy all services
./scripts/deploy/deploy-all.sh

# Or deploy individual service
./scripts/deploy/deploy-response-engine.sh
```

---

## Operational Utilities

### Health Monitoring

```bash
# Check all services
./scripts/utilities/health-check-all.sh

# Output example:
# ✓ Response Engine: HEALTHY
# ✓ MCP Server: DEPLOYED
# ✓ Conversation Manager: DEPLOYED
# ✓ Gmail Ingestion: ACTIVE
```

### Log Management

```bash
# View logs for a service
./scripts/utilities/check-logs.sh response-engine 100

# Available services:
# - response-engine
# - mcp-server
# - conversation-manager
# - gmail-ingestion
```

### Rollback

```bash
# Rollback to previous version
./scripts/utilities/rollback-service.sh response-engine

# Shows revision history and prompts for confirmation
```

### Backup

```bash
# Export all BigQuery data to GCS
./scripts/utilities/export-bigquery-data.sh

# Creates timestamped backup in gs://fdsanalytics-backups/
```

### Manual Ingestion

```bash
# Trigger Gmail ingestion immediately
./scripts/utilities/test-ingestion.sh

# Publishes message to Pub/Sub topic
```

---

## Security Best Practices

### Implemented Security Measures

1. **Least Privilege IAM**: Each service has minimal required permissions
2. **Non-root Containers**: All Dockerfiles use non-root users
3. **Secret Management**: All secrets in Google Secret Manager
4. **Internal Services**: MCP and Conversation Manager are internal-only
5. **Service-to-Service Auth**: IAM-based authentication between services
6. **No Secrets in Code**: All sensitive data in Secret Manager or env vars

### Secrets Management

```bash
# Secrets stored in Secret Manager:
- GEMINI_API_KEY (accessed by response-engine, conversation-manager, gmail-ingestion)
- GMAIL_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS (accessed by gmail-ingestion)

# Never stored in:
- Git repository
- Environment files in repo
- Docker images
```

---

## Cost Optimization

### Implemented Optimizations

1. **Scale to Zero**: All Cloud Run services scale to 0 when idle
2. **Small Images**: Alpine-based images where possible
3. **Multi-stage Builds**: Smaller production images
4. **Efficient Resource Allocation**:
   - Response Engine: 512MB (needs more for processing)
   - MCP/Conversation Manager: 256MB (lightweight)
5. **Query Optimization**: Stored procedures for efficient BigQuery queries

### Estimated Monthly Costs

| Service | Cost |
|---------|------|
| Cloud Run (3 services) | $10-20 |
| Cloud Functions (1) | $2-3 |
| BigQuery Storage | $0.50 |
| BigQuery Queries | $5-10 |
| Secret Manager | $0.10 |
| **Total** | **$18-34/month** |

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Docker Compose Testing**: docker-compose not available in current environment for live testing, but configuration is valid
2. **BigQuery Emulator**: Not included in docker-compose (optional enhancement)
3. **Multi-tenant**: Current setup is single-tenant (by design for v1)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Test docker-compose locally**: Verify all services start correctly
2. **Run initial setup**: Execute setup scripts to create infrastructure
3. **Deploy to production**: Use deploy-all.sh for first deployment
4. **Configure GitHub Secrets**: Add GCP_SA_KEY for CI/CD
5. **Test health checks**: Verify all services are healthy

### Future Enhancements

1. **Terraform/IaC**: Convert bash scripts to Terraform for better state management
2. **Monitoring Dashboards**: Create Cloud Monitoring dashboards
3. **Alert Policies**: Set up alerts for errors, latency, costs
4. **Load Testing**: Stress test services to validate scaling
5. **Backup Automation**: Schedule regular BigQuery backups
6. **Multi-region**: Deploy to multiple regions for HA
7. **Canary Deployments**: Gradual rollout for reduced risk
